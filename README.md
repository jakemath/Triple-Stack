# Triple-Stack
An implementation of 3 stacks simultaneously in an array, with analogous push(), pop() and top() stack functions. The stacks are arranged in the array of template type stack_element in the order [S1, S2, S3, S1, S2, S3, ... S1, S2, S3], and uses modularity to reference elements for each stack (i.e. Stack 1 occupies every array index i such that i %3 = 0, Stack 2 occupies every array index i such that i % 3 = 1, and so on for k stacks for an array of size n where n % k = 0). The topmost elements of each stack is the last occupied array index with proper modularity. The program pushes and pops elements from the corresponding tops and updates them accordingly by moving the reference to the top back by 3 for 3 stacks, or k for k stacks.
